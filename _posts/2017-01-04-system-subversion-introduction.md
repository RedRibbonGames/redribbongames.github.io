This is a sneak peak on the hacking game that we are currently working on called "System Subversion". Everything you see is very early in the build process so will more that likely change in the final game.

The plan is to have it semi-realistic with the game's core element being the terminal window. To make it more player friendly, most commands will always have a way for the player to just click a button and do the same thing. This gif below shows opening the storage window (where all the files the player has are stored are) both through typing in the terminal and by just clicking icons.
